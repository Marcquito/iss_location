<h1>Track the International Space Station!</h1>
<h3>How rad is that?</h3>
<br>
Hi everyone! Here is a bit of python script that can track the location of the ISS on the fly. 
<br>
To get it working with your location:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Replace my Lat Lng with your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    Visit the nasa link within the comments and get the current ISS flight pattern coordinates. These tend to change a few times a year,
    so this needs to be checked once in awhile. Perhaps in the future it'll be great to use AJAX to pull that information.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Cheers!
